# Just a silly Telegram Bot
It fetches you meanings, antonyms and synonyms of different words when provided with right commands which you can see through '/help' command.

## Side commands
Other than assisting you with meanings, antonyms and synonyms it gives witty replies to certain commands.

## Checkout the bot yourself
* Open telegram
* Search for @NerdyNerdsonBot (I just got fed up trying different names)
* Or search with name - Nerd Bot
* Just start the chat. It will assist you.

### PS - 
Obviously the chat won't reply if it won't be online from the server side. However, I'll try to keep it online as much as possible.

### More features
I have lots of ideas that I can try with this bot so no, it isn't it. More features will be added whenever I'll get time to work on it. Right now it was just a 3 hours minor project but will definitely keep working on it.
